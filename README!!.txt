These are default notebook files as used by the instructor in the course which I took
(here is the link https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-reinforcement/?couponCode=ST9MT71624)
The instructor updated the code files provided in the course last week only(I got a notification on my gmail)
The problem was the version conflict of the brax library, but now the instructor has fixed it and updated the 
code files and these are the updated ones in this folder.
The ones which are with the identical names in the other folder have been changed by me to fix the erros
that occured due to the version change. I used some quick fixes.
Overall, there is no change in the implementation of the algorithm, so you may use any of the notebooks in any of the two
folders with identical file names.
